						<h3>Brief History</h3>
						<p class="text-justify animate-box">
							We started the vision of discipleship officially in the year 2016 
							when we were reintroduced to church growth through discipleship.
							 Through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, we named our fast
							  growing cell network Church Without Walls, as an identity within
							   NCC. We believe nothing would limit our spread to any part of 
							   the world God would send us and we wouldn't have boundaries 
							   because of the influx of people God will be adding to us (Zechariah 2:4-5 paraphrased).
							    We have raised generations of youths who are now young adults,
								' leading churches all over and we are still raising more. 
								This move led to starting a youth centre in Elebele, Bayelsa state in 2018, 
								another in Benin in the year 2022 and lately another at Otuoke, 
								also in Bayelsa state last year October, 2023. 
								We are soon taking over a centre in Elebele, Bayelsa state by the
								 end of this month - May. All these centres are being led / pastored by young men 
								 raised through our discipleship network.
								 We are also trusting God for a model center around Oluyole Estate, Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria

						<h3>Our Vision</h3>
						<p class="text-justify animate-box">In the book of Acts, the local Church met in people's houses and other places convenient for the people. Synagogue was just a place to gather on Sunday to celebrate the risen Lord and because it would be open for public use on the same day as Jews worship on Saturday. The disciples did not need to worry about a physical building before starting a church, because wherever they gathered for fellowship was regarded as the church. With this system, the church grew rapidly because the people are considered as the church not the building. The people I believed built the buildings they needed in different cities as they grew in number and in the knowledge of God. 
							Likewise, at New Covenant Church Without Walls, we will not also be limited by walls or finance in implementing whatever vision God placed on our hearts. To disciple men does not cost much than the heart God has touched and is willing to be used. We are not giving in to any barrier, language, color or Race; we are a city without walls just as God has promised to be a wall of fire around it. (Zech.2:4 - and said to him: "Run, tell that young man, 'Jerusalem will be a city without walls because of the great number of men and livestock in it. 5 - And I myself will be a wall of fire around it,' declares the LORD, 'and I will be its glory within).
							We will be raising generations of soldiers for Christ not weaklings. There is no segregation like clergy and laity. All are disciples, following a leader who is in turn following Christ. Each person raised as leaders of hundreds and thousands just as the Lord told us from the beginning of this move: 1Chr.12:2 - they were armed with bows and were able to shoot arrows or to sling stones right-handed or left-handed; they were kinsmen of Saul from the tribe of Benjamin): 14 - These Gadites were army commanders; the least was a match for a hundred, and the greatest for a thousand.
							
							Over the years, believers have found it difficult to submit unto discipleship. Hence, the increasing lists of half-baked believers within the church circuit globally has become worrisome. There is need to qualify the level of faith of a church attendee by asking if he is a norminal or born again Christian. The excuse of time availability is chief among reasons, but we have also seen well discipled believers who have excelled well in their chosen career while still doing God's work. We would love to increase such good testimony. We believe whoever you are and whatever your profession, you will be a minister of God and will represent Him through your profession. Your office or work place will be a good ground to exhibit your calling and ministry which is simply making disciples of nations (Matthew 28:19-20). Trusting God, we will continue to have men joining the group from all spheres of life until we become a force that cannot be ignored in every society we find ourselves. We believe we would attract the hand of God in bringing revival as this is our goal.
